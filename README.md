Life expectancy is an important measure of a countryâ€™s wellbeing. Despite advancement in technology, declines and gaps in life expectancy still happen around the world. This paper investigates the relationship between different variables and life expectancy and aims to predict overall life expectancy to explain the causes of different scenarios of life expectancy around the world and to assist in producing measures to improve it. Exploratory data analysis was done to understand the data better and to determine variables that were highly correlated with life expectancy. Different supervised machine learning algorithms were compared for the predictive model. The result was that an increase in schooling years and income composition of resources as well as lower under-five deaths, adult mortality rate and deaths caused by HIV/aids, lead to higher life expectancy. Random Forest Regression was the best predictive model, with R2 score, 0.96, mean squared error, 3.45 and mean absolute error, 1.19. To conclude, the variables determined from the results should be taken into account for the improvement of future life expectancy.
